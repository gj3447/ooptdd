`build_outcome_records` turns a list of plain pytest report dicts into the
structured event envelopes ooptdd ships. Keeping this pure means it is trivially
unit-testable and identical across every backend.

Envelope shape (one JSON object per event)::

      ...event-specific fields...
    }

We emit the correlation id under three keys because different stores index
different column names; carrying all three keeps "one query by id" working no
matter which backend you point at.

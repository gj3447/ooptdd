"""Domain ports — the abstractions the engine depends on, owned by the domain layer.

The :class:`Backend` Protocol is a *port* (hexagonal architecture / dependency inversion):
the engine (gate, verify) is written against this interface, and concrete drivers
(memory, OpenObserve, OTLP, …) are *adapters* that implement it in :mod:`ooptdd.backends`.
Keeping the port here — not in the adapter package — is what lets the dependency arrow
point engine → domain (never engine → a concrete adapter), enforced by the architecture
fitness test.

Beyond the backend, this module owns the small **value objects and ports the engine reads
against**: :class:`QueryResult` (an answer, with its completeness/reachability honesty),
:class:`TimeWindow` / :class:`QuerySpec` (a typed *query intent* instead of bare kwargs),
:class:`BackendCaps` (typed capabilities instead of ad-hoc ``getattr``), and the
:class:`Clock` port (injectable time, so the engine's polling is deterministic and
sleep-free under test). The bridge functions :func:`backend_caps` and :func:`fetch` let the
engine use the typed surface while every legacy two-method backend keeps working untouched.

A backend does exactly two required things: ``ship(events)`` (write) and
``query(cid, *, since_us, until_us)`` (read back, reporting whether the query itself was
*reachable* and *complete*). The interesting logic — the LTL₃ verdict, the polling window,
the clock-skew buffer — lives *above* the port, identical no matter where events land.

Two load-bearing honesty fields on :class:`QueryResult`:
  - ``reachable`` distinguishes "the store says no such event" (absent / ⊥) from "I could
    not even ask the store" (inconclusive / ?). Conflating them turns a blip into a flake.
  - ``complete`` distinguishes a full answer from a partial one (a paging/row cap was hit).
    A truncated read may undercount or hide an offender, so the verdict layer must refuse to
    treat ``complete=False`` as a clean pass — the same discipline as ``reachable``.

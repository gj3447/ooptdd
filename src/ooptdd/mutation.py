"""Gate mutation testing — does the gate actually discriminate, or is it vacuously green?

ooptdd's honest limit: *"a gate that only checks existence won't catch a wrong value."*
A gate that asserts ``present: [{event: cycle}]`` passes whether the cycle's verdict is
PASS or NG — it has a blind spot. This module quantifies that. Given a *passing*
(events, gate) pair, it derives the deviations the gate **should** catch and re-runs the
gate on each:

  * ``drop:<x>``     — remove the events satisfying a required expectation. A gate that
                       required them must go RED.
  * ``corrupt:<x>``  — for a ``where``-constrained expectation, change the matched field
                       value. A gate that constrains that value must go RED; one that only
                       checks existence stays GREEN — a **surviving mutant = a blind spot**.
  * ``inject_error`` — add an ERROR-level record. Caught only when the gate forbids errors
                       (``forbid_errors`` / ``OOPTDD_FORBID_ERRORS`` / an ``absent`` rule).

The mutation *score* is caught / total; survivors name exactly which deviation the gate
waved through. Ordering mutations (reorder) are out of scope here: the in-memory backend
stamps one timestamp per ``ship``, so reorder can't be observed — use a backend with real
per-event timestamps for that.

This is the Schemathesis idea (systematic spec-derived negative cases) applied to gates
rather than APIs. From the ooptdd-oss prometheus cycle (A5,
seed-ooptdd-negwing-mutant-allowlist-20260618).

"""The read half: poll a backend and turn what we see into a verdict.

This is where ooptdd earns its "positive" — `ship()` only *claims* delivery; here
we read the store back and assert the records exist.

The verdict is three-valued on purpose — the **LTL₃** semantics of Bauer, Leucker &
Schallhart (TOSEM 2011): ⊤ / ⊥ / ?. A monitor only ever sees a *prefix* of the trace,
so plain boolean truth is wrong (ooptdd evaluates a counting/past-time *fragment* of
LTL, not full LTL — see METHODOLOGY.md "What three-valued precisely means"):

    present       the expected record was observed                      (⊤ witness)
    absent        the query worked but the record never showed up        (⊥ — real
                  miss; this is the silent-ingest-loss signal)
    inconclusive  we could not query the store at all (unreachable)      (? — not
                  the system-under-test's fault)

The polling concern (recompute the clock-skew window every attempt, back off, track
⊥-vs-? ) is factored into one generic arrival loop, :func:`poll_until_present`, that is
shape-agnostic: a caller supplies an ``evaluate_prefix`` callback that decides, from each
freshly-queried prefix, whether the thing it is waiting for has arrived. :func:`verify_trace`
(the pytest ``test_session`` summary) and :func:`verify_gate` (an *arbitrary* gate spec for
any domain events, by cid) are both thin specializations of it — the same loop, the same
LTL₃ mapping, the same generic streaming monitor underneath.

`verify_policy` then maps the verdict + mode to a build decision. Crucially,
`inconclusive` never fails the build even in strict mode: demoting an
infrastructure outage to a falsification is how "timeout" becomes a flaky test.

    """Is this GREEN gate result *irrevocable* over the prefix — i.e. safe to settle
    'present' on a NON-final poll?

    A non-final poll sees only a prefix of the trace. A gate that is ``ok`` over that
    prefix can still be flipped by later-arriving events whenever it carries an
    anti-monotone check: ``absent``/``forbid`` (incl. the injected ``forbid_errors``
    wing), an exact/upper-bound count (``==``/``<=``/``<``/``!=``), ``heartbeat``,
    ``ratioMetric``, ``invariant``, ``metamorphic``, ``conforms`` — all of which pass
    vacuously/provisionally on a violation-free-so-far prefix. Settling early there is
    the forgery path the 2026-07-08 audit named (residual #1): the late violation never
    reaches the verdict.

    The kernel already answers monotonicity per check: LTL₃ ``SAT`` means "no extension
    of this prefix can falsify" (:data:`ooptdd.engine.monitor.SAT`), and only the
    monotone-positive automata (``>=``/``>`` counts, ``present``) ever latch it. So a
    prefix green is settled iff every gating check reports ``verdict == SAT``. A check
    without a kernel verdict (``external:``, custom ``@check`` predicates) is
    conservatively treated as revocable — fail-closed. Signature enforcement
    (``require_signature``) verifies the WHOLE hash chain, which a later off-chain event
    still breaks, so it forbids early settle as well.

    ⚠ ``must_order``/``trajectory`` (OrderMonitor) latch SAT too, but their SAT is only
    valid for extensions appended in TIMESTAMP order — and the poller feeds prefixes in
    INGEST order. A later-ingested event carrying an EARLIER timestamp rewrites the
    first-occurrence map and can flip an ordered SAT to VIOL (grill F1: a real early-settle
    forgery). So an order check is treated as revocable-by-reorder here regardless of its
    within-prefix SAT — a gate with any gating order check must poll to the final window.
    (The within-call batch verdict is unaffected: there the stream is timestamp-sorted.)

"""ooptdd — logs/traces as the test specification and ground truth.

ooptdd (also written LTDD, "Log-based / observability positive-TDD") inverts the
trust relationship of a normal test: instead of believing a function's return
value (or an agent's "done!"), it asserts that the *events the system actually
emitted* arrived in an external store.

    Red      write the expected event-trace spec (it fails — nothing emits it yet)
    Green    the implementation emits structured events; a verifier polls the
             store and *positively asserts they arrived*
    Refactor the same event contract still holds (golden-trace regression)

The word **positive** is load-bearing: `ship()` returning without raising is a
*claim*, not proof. A separate verifier reads the store back and asserts the
records exist. (Motivating failure: a silent 401 dropped ingest for 22 hours and
every "shipped OK" log lied.)

Public API:
    build_outcome_records   pure: pytest reports -> structured event records
    verify_trace            poll a backend for the pytest summary, return an LTL3 verdict
    verify_gate             poll until an arbitrary gate spec arrives for a cid (generic)
    poll_until_present      the generic, shape-agnostic arrival loop underneath both
    verify_policy           verdict + mode -> build decision
    session_finish          build -> ship -> verify -> policy (the orchestrator)
    evaluate, evaluate_events   run a gate spec (read+judge) / judge already-fetched events
    can_i_deploy            Pact-style multi-gate deploy decision
    check                   @decorator to register a custom gate check-predicate (seam)
    compile_check, LiveMonitorSet   kernel API: rule -> Monitor -> feed a live stream
    get_backend, BackendRegistry    resolve a Backend driver by name
    QuerySpec, TimeWindow, BackendCaps, Clock, SystemClock   the domain ports/value objects
    assert_gate, assert_present   DeepEval-style in-test trace assertions
    Backend, QueryResult, MemoryBackend

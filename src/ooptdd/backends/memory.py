"""In-process backend — zero network, zero infra, deterministic.

This is the default backend and the single biggest lever for adoption: you can
run the whole ooptdd loop (ship -> verify -> verdict) in a plain `pytest` with
nothing installed and nothing running. The demo, the plugin's own test suite,
and most users' first green all ride on this.

Events live in a module-global store so that a `ship` in one place and a
`verify` in another (e.g. the pytest session hook) see the same data within a
process. `reachable` is always True — there is no network to fail — so the only
verdicts you can get are `present` or `absent`, never `inconclusive`. That makes
it perfect for reproducing the silent-ingest-loss bug on purpose.

Why this mock is legitimate (and where that claim is proven): it passes the SAME
executable contract as the real drivers (backends/conformance.py) and its caps
refuse the external-judge role (independent=False) — contract parity + honest
caps, receipt-pinned in tests/test_contract_mock_parity_receipt.py.
